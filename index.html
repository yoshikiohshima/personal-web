	      <h3>About Me</h3>
	      <p>
		  I have been working on creating new programming languages and environments, designing and implementing dynamic interactive systems and applications, especially for the education field. I have published dozens of academic papers and served a program committee member for conferences and workshops.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		  I was working on an optimizing compiler project and also a research prototype of a programming language with nested transactions at the graduate school of Tokyo Institute of Technology. It was fine... but looking back, I think was feeling it was a bit too narrowly focused  but I did not know how much a bigger picture was there in the field of computing.  It all changed when an interesting twist changed the course of my life.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		  As shown below, I got to closely work with Dr. Alan Kay and his group over decades. There are questions like "what <em>is</em> computing?" in the Koan-like sense that "what is computing if you take away all hardware in front of your eyes?", and "what is means to have computing for humanity?". The group was not only talk about those stuff, but also were <em>actually</em> making those ideas concrete. 
	      </p>

	      <p>
		  I consider myself an "above-average" programmer but I have been trying to learn about things. I think that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/FvmTSpJU-Xc?t=2067">the knowledge and outlook</a> I accumulated over time are making some differences on what I create.

			  <h4>Squeak Smalltalk (1997-)</h4>
			  I attended OOPSLA 1997 in Atlanta as a student volunteer. An interesting twist of fate got me in touch with John Maloney of the Squeak Team (via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/overview/leadership.html">Professor Satoshi Matusoka</a>) at the reception hall, and Prof. Matsuoka volunteered me to try porting Squeak to a PDA called Zaurus from the Sharp corporation in Japan that Prof. Matsuoka was carrying (and showing off). I only had very vague idea of what Smalltalk was about. I was familiar with Emacs, and had some sense that an interactive and scriptable computing system as a whole is good... But I was totally blown away that the entire system (<em>really</em>) can be all coherently created as a dynamic system . Since then, many things I do in computing have been influenced by the notion of whole system design, dynamic modification of a living system and education aspect of computing all comes with Smalltalk and Squeak.

			  <h4>Porting Squeak to Zaurus PDA (1998)</h4>
			  Squeak was designed to be extremely portable so that it can run on wide variety of hardware platforms, including low-power handheld devices. I started working on porting Squeak to Zaurus in 1998, and thanks to lucky coincidences (Sharp just released a public SDK, and the latest hardware just barely got ennough memory, etc), I managed to make the port work. For this, and some other contributions I made for the Squeak Project, I was invited by Dr. Alan Kay's group to visit Walt Disney Imagineering R&D in Los Angeles and to OOPSLA that was held in Vancouver that year. It also marked my first occasion to make a transit at an airport (SFO), and I missed the plane.

Not unlike Squeak, NetFront was architected so that it can be ported to a new platform by supplying platform-dependent code.

			  <h4>Parks PDA(2000)</h4>
			  Walt Disney Imagineering R&D was interested in emerging portable electronic devices (Personal Digital Assistants) and exploring what they can do with them to enhace guest experiences. Around that time, a model of Zaurus PDA had a unique device that had 1) an out-door viewable color screen, 2) enough performance to play audio and frame-based animation at the quality that Disney requires, 3) an external storage slot to store media-rich content, and most notably 4) a dynamic object system called Squeak that allowed us to make a new custom user interface framework that in tur allowed the designers to create high quality content quickly. We spent two weeks in late October and November in Orlando and stayed at an affiliated hotel. Once the test started going smoothly, I got a lot of free time and went all those parks and cut the queue lines with my R&D badge. We anticipated some news coverage of our test, but the Bush-Gore thing happened and there was no space on newspaper for that kind of fun stuff.

			  At Disney, I was officially working on other projects (like the ones mentioned above and others) than Squeak itself (though I was using it for some projects and contributed to it). The 9/11 attack also hit the bottom line of the Disney company, and the Squeak team eventually were laid off. I was kept a bit longer than the Squeak team members but eventually also let go. I would have to return to Japan due to the visa restriction, but thanks to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.twinsun.com/">Dr. Masanobu Matsuo</a>, I got a positioon at his company called Twin Sun. I was more and more closely in the projects of Viewpoints Research Institute, which Alan Kay and Kim Rose founded. A major project of Viewpoints was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://vpri.org/work/tlpiese.htm">Etoys</a>, which is the end-user authoring environment (built on top of Squeak). From around this time, I was involved in improving and extending Etoys and over time took the leading role of the project.

			  <h4>Etoys for OLPC (2008-)</h4>
			  The OLPC (One Laptop per Child) project aimed to create an inexpensive laptop that is designed to help children around the world. Our group was involved in early discussions of software design. There was an idea to use Squeak as the main foundation for the laptop so that the user (chidren) can engage a "learning by doing" style activity. That plan did not pan out, but we put considerable effort to make the Etoys run as an application.  Because there were not much applications for OLPC where users can actually make things, Etoys was popular for certain teachers and learners. I was taking the leading role of the effort.

			  <h4>The STEPS Project (2007-2013)</h4>
			  Viewpoints Research received a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundatation to demonstrate the feasibility of an idea that the kernel of an entire personal computing system can be written in about 20,000 lines of code. That includes the compiler, the network driver, the memory management system, the graphics system, text formatting algorithm, application framework and applications. It was a large group effort, and various members came up with many interesting ideas and systems. I took on the task to make an application framework, and I chose Functional Reactive Programming as its basis, but with a twist of allowng dynamic modification of running code. Also, we designed the framework so that all "applications" on the framework can be embedded in to another. The declarative nature of reactive descriptionn, and not having distinction between application and widgets allowed as to make a universal authorinng application.

Three of us combined had considerable experiences in making various end-user programming systems, but we had been bothered by the fact that none of those systems we created were truly "general purpose", in a sense that it is powerful enough to write complex applications, such as the blocks-based programming systems itself. John was the main architect, and I worked on various parts such as designing a module system, porting the virtual machine to 64-bit platforms, etc.

			  <h4>Kanto (2017)</h4>
			  I was interested in computer-based collaboration, especially a place where people can make something together and learn from each other. It occurred to me that a screensharing with WebRTC and a channel where a remote user can send events, we can create a collaborative environment for different blacks-based editors. I modified the Snap! editor to allow multiple pointers and hook up the WebRTC based collaboration system to have a functional collaborative blocks-eiting environment. The same collaboration framework can be used to make SqueakJS and web version of GP collaborative as well.

			  The name of the system is Kanto. The tradition of this kind of collaboration space was started by a system called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/Softviz/CACM-Debugging/Kansas/Kansas.html">Kansas</a>, named after a US state that is a large rectagular flat area. Squeak followed its own implemtation called Nebraska. As I was working with Jens, I thought it might be fun to pick a flat area in Germany.. but when he told me that it would be "Schleswig-Holstein", a German name probably was not going to fly (or even unpronounciable for many people) I picked "Kanto" in Japan as the name of the system.

			  When Y Combinator Research could no longer support our research activity, David Smith and some of my colleagues, such as Dan Ingalls, Vanessa Freudenberg and Aran Lunzer, formed a start up company. The main goal was to have the realtime collaboration technology going on the Web. The fundamental algorithm was devised decades earlier by the original Croquet group. We reimplemented the algorithm in JavaScript and for JavaScript, and created an SDK so that a realtime collaborative application can be created easily. While the SDK provides a good foundation, making a larger application that requires dynamic DOM manipulation and scriping them needs a higher-level abstraction. I designed and created a virtual DOM based application framework (with help from colleagues, certainly!). I also architected and wrote majority of code of the shared space application called Q.

			  <h4>Viewpoints Intelligent Archive (2018-)</h4>
			  I am interested in the history of computing. Viewpoints Research Insitute had over one thousand video tapes from 70's and on. Many of those tapes are Alan Kay's talks but they include some internal meetings of Apple ATG, and Walt Disney Imagineering, etc. I have digitized all content and archived. Some of those movies are uploaded to my channel of YouTube. I maintain a web site called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tinlizzie.org/IA">Viewpoints Intelligent Archive</a>. that lists available movies of talks by Alan, and papers by Alan and other Viewpoints folks, including myself.

		  <h3>Academic Activity</h3>
		  <p>
		      I have published and presented papers at international and domestic conferences and workshops. Also, I have served as a program committee for various conferences.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		      It is suffice to put a link to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Boq_L4sAAAAJ&hl=ja&oi=ao">my Google Scholar page</a>. Some papers I authored or co-authored are referenced quite often.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		      Here is the (partial) list of conference and workshops I served as program committee.  The C5 conferences were "ours" in the sense tht Viewpoints was organizing it. But others invite me to join because (I think) I tend to provide details reviews with technical and historical contexts that are different from typical reviewers provide.  (But it appears that I do more reviewing recently and less writing my own.)

		  <p>
		      I received followign degrees.
		  </p>

		  <ul>
		      <li>BSc from Department of Information Science at Tokyo Institute of Technology (1994)</li>
		      <li>MSc from Department of Mathematical and Computing Sciences at
Tokyo Institute of Technology.  Project: Developing a concurrent programming language with nested transactions (1996)</li>
		      <li>Ph.D from Department of Mathematical and Computing Sciences at
Tokyo Institute of Technology. Project: Designing and developing an end-user programming
			  environment for constructing massively parallel programs (2006).</li>
		  </ul>

		  As you can see these are all from the same college and actually from the same group. (It is not uncommon in Japan). I was enrolled in the Ph.D. course after I finished my masters degree but I took a leave of absence during the course. Japanese universities have a system where a person has enough to show, they can still award a Ph.D. to an applicant. I took an advantage of it and got the degree on a topic that was different from what I would have done if I stayed.

		  <p>
		      And here is my past and current employers and the title of the position.  It may appear that I am changing the job often but it is not actually the case, Viewpoints Research Institute, SAP Labs, and Y Combinator Research are basically the same group but sponsored by different benefactors, grants and companpies.  It was the time period the core group sttayed together to achieve the same goal.
		  </p>

		  <ul>
		      <li>Computer Scientist at Croquet Corporation (2018 to present)</li>
		      <li>Principal Investigator at Human Advancement Research Community (HARC), Y Combinator Research (2016 - 2017)</li>
		      <li>Principal Investigator at Communications Design Group, SAP Labs (2014 - 2016)</li>
		      <li>Researcher at Viewpoints Research Institute (2007 - 2014)</li>
		      <li>Software Researcher and Developer at Twin Sun, Inc. (2002 - 2006)</li>
		      <li>Intern and Technical Staff Member at Walt Disney Imagineering
  R&D (2000 - 2002)</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>
		      I also took some part time jobs at companies such as Vianai.

		  <h3 id="other">Other Interests and Activities</h3>
		  <p>
		      I play various sports, but volleyball was the most serious one.  I played it since middle school and played for the college versity team (even though it was a geek's tech college, it was quite ompetitive).
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		      I am an assistant coach for a U-12 soccer team. I watch a lot of soccer games but don't have real experience, though.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		      I teach a STEM class for high school students at a Japanese Saturday school in Los Angeles. I pick a topic from wide variety of fields, and often try to use interactive computer based explanations.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		      I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/yoshikiohshima">Twitter</a> and write something once a week or so. Around 2019, I was writing about one answer a day on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jp.quora.com/profile/%E5%A4%A7%E5%B3%B6-%E8%8A%B3%E6%A8%B9-Yoshiki-Ohshima">Quora</a> but the rate of contribution is much lower.  I have the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://squeaker.hatenablog.com/">hatena blog</a> and again I used to update it once a day but it is mostly dormant.
