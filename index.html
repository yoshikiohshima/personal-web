      <p>
	  Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
	  I have been working on programming languages, programming environments, system architecture design. I also have served many academic conferences as the program committee member.
      </p>
      <p>
At the graduate school of Tokyo Institute of Technology, I was working on an optimizing compiler project, and also a research prototype of a programming language with nested transactions. It was fine... But I was not aware of big pictures on the field of computing. It all changed when an interesting twist changed the course of my life.

		  Under supervision of Professor Masataka Sassa, I worked on a compiler construction project. The project's aim was to write all stages of an optimizing compiler in declarative forms, especially in various variations of Attribute Grammar.

		  <h4>Squeak Smalltalk (1997-):</h4>
		  While I was studying progrmminng languages at graduate school, I went to OOPSLA in Atlanta as a student volunteer. An interesting twist of fate got me in touch with John Maloney of the Squeak Team (via Prof Satoshi Matsuoka) at the reception hall, and Prof. Matsuoka volunteered me to try porting the Squeak proogrmming system to a PDA called Sharp Zaurus that Prof. Matsuoka was carrying. Up to that point, I was familiar with Emacs and had some sense that an interactive and scriptable computing system is good, but I was totally blown away that really the entire system can be all uniformly written in a dynamic system.  Since then, many things I do in computing are influenced by the notion of whole system design, dynamic modification of a living system and education aspect of computing all comes with Smalltalk and Squeak.

		  <h4>Porting Squeak to Zaurus PDA (1998):</h4>
Squeak was designed to work on wide variety of hardware platforms, including low-power handheld devices. I started working on porting Squeak to Zaurus, and thanks to lucky coincidence, such as Sharp just released a public SDK timely, and the memory foot print requirement of very minimum Squeak was just barely small enough to fit within the latest Zaurus model, and of course the software architecture of Sqeuak was very portable, I managed to make the port work. I was inviated by Dr. Alan Kay's group to visit Walt Disney Imagineering R & D and to OOPSLA. (It was also my first occasion to make a transit at an airport, and I missed the plane.)

		  <h4>Porting NetFront Web browser to Zaurus PDA (2000):</h4>
		  The ACCESS company was spearheading the mobile web industry with their NetFront browser. Not unlike Squeak, NetFront was architected so that it can be ported to a new platform by supplying platform-dependent code. I blatantly re-purposed some of the code I wrote for Squeak to the NetFront browser. But hey, it is open source and I wrote it.

		  <h4>Parks PDA(2000):</h4>
		  Walt Disney Imagineering R&D was interested in the emerging portable electronic devices (Personal Digital Assistants). Around that time, the Zaurus PDA from the Sharp Corporation in Japan had a unique device that had 1) an out-door viewable color screen, 2) enough performance to play audio and frame-based animation at the quality that Disney requires, 3) an external storage slot to store media-rich content, and most notably 4) a dynamic object system called Squeak that allowed us to make a new custom user interface framework that in tur allowed the designers to create high quality content quickly.

		  This is an experimental of a new interactive theme park attraction. In a phone booth large enough to fit a family, we put a large flat screen as one of the walls. A cast member can puppet a 3D character (Stitch) real time with a game controller and chat with the family, and at the end of a short session, Stitch takes a photo of the family, and give a printed version the family. I worked on the code that captures the image from a hidden video camera. The experiment won the 10th annual Themed Entertainment Association Award.

		  At Disney, I was officially working on other projects (like the ones mentioned above and others) than Squeak (though I was using it for some projects and contributed to it). The 9/11 attack also hit the bottom line of the Disney company, and the Squeak team eventually were laid off. I wask kept a bit longer but eventually also let go. I would have to return to Japan but thanks to Dr. Masanobu Matsuo, I got a positioon at a company called Twin Sun. At Twin Sun. I then was even more closely involved in the projects at Viewpoints Research which Alan Kay and Kim Rose founded. A major project was Etoys, which is the end-user authoring environment (built on top of Squeak). From around this time, I was involved in improving and extending Etoys and over time took the leading role of the project.

		  <h4>Etoys for OLPC (2008-):</h4>
		  The OLPC (One Laptop per Child) project aimed to create an inexpensive laptop that is designed to help children around the world. Our group was involved in some early discussion of the planning and software design. There was an idea to put Squeak as the main platform for the laptop so that the user (chidren) can engage a "learning by doing" style activity. Though that plan did not pan out, we put considerable effort to make the Etoys run as an application.  Because there were not much applications for OLPC where users can actually make things, Etoys was popular for certain teachers and learners.  I was taking the leading role of the effort.

		  <h4>The STEPS Project (2007-2013):</h4>
		  Viewpoints Research received a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundatation to demonstrate the idea that the kernel for the entire personal computing system should be written in just about 20,000 lines of code.  That includes the compiler, the network driver, the memory management system, the graphics system, text formatting algorithm, application framework and applications. It was a large group effort.  I took on the application framework that is inspired by Functional Reactive Programming, with a twist of allowng dynamic modification of running code. Also, we designed it so that all "applications" on the framework can be embedded into another. The declarative nature of reactive descriptionn, and not having distinction between application and widgets allowed as to make a universal authorinng application.

		  <h4>GP (2013-)</h4>
		  With John Maloney and Jens Moenig, I worked on a new blocks-based programming system Project called GP. Three of us had considerable experiences in making various end-user programming systems, but we had been bothered by the fact that none of those system we created were truly "general purpose" in a sense that it is powerful enough to write complex applications including itself. John Maloney was the lead and I worked on various parts such as designing a module system, porting the virtual machine to 64-bit platforms, etc.

		  <h4>Kanto (2017)</h4>
		  I was always interested in a collaborative work on computer especially making something together or learing from each other. I thought that a screensharing via WebRTC and a channel channel where a remote user can send events, we can create a collaborative environment for different blacks-based editors. I modified the Snap! editor to allow multiple pointers and hook up the WebRTC based collaboration system to have a functional collaborative blocks-eiting environment. The same collaboration framework can be used to make SqueakJS and web version of GP collaborative as well.

		  I got an urge to make a yet another particle simulation system where program can be modified while a simulation is running.

When the company is officially launched, I continued to work as a contractor at Vianai. I contributed to the  demo that Vishal and Dan Amelang showed at the Oracle Open World event.

		  <h4>JavaScript version of Croquet (2017-):</h4>
		  When Y Combinator Research could no longer support the research activity, David Smith and some of my colleagues formed a start up company. The main goal was to have real time collaboration technology going on the Web. The fundamental algorithm was devised by the earlier Croquet group done in Smalltalk. We reimplemented the algorithm for JavaScript, and created an SDK so that anybody can create a real time collaborative application. While the SDK provides good foundation, making a larger applications that require dynamic DOM manipulation and scriping them needs a higher level application framework. I spearheaded the effort to make the application framework. I also architected and wrote majority of code of the shared space application called Q.

Alan wrote an elaborated essay that he wants to have dynamic interactive programming elements. The paper version of the book cannot contain it (obviously) but with John Maloney, we created the "active essay" version of Alan's article.
